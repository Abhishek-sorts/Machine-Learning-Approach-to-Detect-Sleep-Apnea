# Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Detect-Sleep-Apnea
We built a machine learning model using the Random Forest algorithm to detect signs of sleep apnea based on biomedical signal patterns. The system was trained to distinguish between normal and apnea-affected breathing cycles, delivering promising accuracy and reliability.
